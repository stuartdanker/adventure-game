# adventure-game
This is just something I built to learn Python. I'm starting from zero, so the code might be inelegant or downright redundant. It's actually for those who know NEXT Academy in Malaysia because the map is based on that.

It's a text game reminiscent of my childhood spent in MUD servers. It's elementary, but I hope you enjoy it anyhow!
